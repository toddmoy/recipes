# Harira Soup

## Ingredients

- extra virgin olive oil
- 1 large yellow onion, finely chopped
- 2 celery stalks, chopped
- Kosher salt
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne
- 2 14-ounce cans crushed tomatoes
- 3 Tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 cup packed chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 cup green lentils, rinsed
- 1 cup red lentils, rinsed
- 1 14-ounce can chickpeas
- 7 cups vegetable stock, preferably low-sodium
- 1/4 cup long grain rice, rinsed, or 1/4 cup broken vermicelli
- Lemon wedges for serving

## Instructions

1. In a large Dutch Oven, heat 4 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onions, celery, and carrots. Season with kosher salt. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring regularly until softened.
1. Add the garlic and spices and cook for a couple of 1 to 2 minutes, stirring regularly.
1. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, cilantro, lentils (both green and red), and chickpeas. Add a dash more kosher salt and cook for 5 minutes, stirring.
1. Add the broth and raise the heat. Bring to a boil for 5 minutes, then turn the heat to low. Cover and let simmer for 45 minutes or until the legumes are fully cooked and very tender (check occasionally and plan to add more stock or water. The soup will be thick, but it should not be too thick that you cannot pour it. Make sure to adjust the salt as you add more liquid.)
1. Stir in the rice and cook for another 15 or until the rice is fully cooked.
1. Serve with lemon wedges.
