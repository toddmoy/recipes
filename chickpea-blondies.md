# Chickpea Blondies

## Ingredients

* Cooking Spray
* 1 can (15 ounces) chickpeas, rinsed and drained
* 1/2 cup all natural peanut butter (or almond butter)
* 1/3 cup pure maple syrup or agave nectar (you can also use honey if you're not vegan)
* 2 teaspoons vanilla
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/3 cup vegan (or regular) chocolate chips plus 2 tablespoons
* Coarse sea salt, for sprinkling

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and spray 8x8 inch pan with nonstick cooking spray.
1. In a food processor, add all ingredients except chocolate chips and process until batter is smooth. 
1. Fold in 1/3 cup of chocolate chips, I like to use dark chocolate because it has less sugar but it's up to you. Note: Batter will be thick and super delicious, so you could actually just eat it on it's own!
1. Spread batter evenly in prepared pan then sprinkle 2 tablespoons of chocolate chips on top. (The batter may stick to your spatula, so I like to spray my spatula with nonstick cooking spray first.)
1. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean and edges are a tiny bit brown. The batter may look underdone, but you don't want them to dry out!
1. Cool pan for 20 minutes on wire rack. Sprinkle with sea salt then cut into squares. Makes 16 blondies. Store covered in the fridge for up to 3-5 days.
