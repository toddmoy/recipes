# Empanada Dough

## Ingredients

* 2 1/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
* 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
* 1 stick (1/2 cup) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
* 1 large egg
* 1/3 cup ice water
* 1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar

## Instructions

1. Sift flour with salt into a large bowl and blend in butter with your fingertips or a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal with some (roughly pea-size) butter lumps.
1. Beat together egg, water, and vinegar in a small bowl with a fork. Add to flour mixture, stirring with fork until just incorporated. (Mixture will look shaggy.)
1. Turn out mixture onto a lightly floured surface and gather together, then knead gently with heel of your hand once or twice, just enough to bring dough together. Form dough into a flat rectangle and chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, at least 1 hour.
