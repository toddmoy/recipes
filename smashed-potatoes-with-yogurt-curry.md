# Smashed Potatoes with Yogurt Curry

## Ingredients

- 2 pounds red or Yukon Gold baby potatoes
- salt
- 1/3 cup olive oil
- Salt and pepper, to taste

**Curry Yogurt Dip**

- 1 cup plain yogurt (can use regular, Greek or lebne)
- ⅓ cup Brooklyn Delhi Curry Mustard (Available on Amazon or a store near you)
- Brooklyn Delhi Guntur Sannam Hot Sauce (Available on Amazon or a store near you)
- Fresh mint and dill, minced

## Instructions

Preheat the oven to 450º F. Place potatoes in a large pot with cold water and a hearty amount of salt. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until potatoes are fork-tender, about 15-20 minutes. Make sure to check on them as you don't want them to fall apart. Cooking times may vary depending on the size of your potatoes. Drain and let the potatoes rest for about 10 minutes to dry and cool slightly.

Place potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet and gently smash them down (a measuring cup works well). Drizzle oil over potatoes and season generously with salt and pepper. Toss gently to coat evenly (I use my hands). Roast for about 35-40 minutes, until golden and crispy.

While the potatoes are roasting, stir together the yogurt and Curry Mustard. Drip on generous amounts of Guntur Sannam Hot Sauce. Sprinkle the dip with some of the mint and dill. Once potatoes are nice and crispy, remove from the oven, sprinkle with the remaining fresh herbs and serve hot!
