- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ teaspoon five spice powder**
- ¼ teaspoon salt

**Soup**
- 2 cups sliced leeks, about 1 large leek
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
- 5 cloves of garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes, optional but encouraged
- ⅛ teaspoon five spice powder**
- 2 large sprigs of sage, about 10 leaves total
- 2 bay leaves
- 10 cups vegetable broth or your favorite no-chicken broth
- ½ pound of your favorite dried pasta like gemilli or shells (half a box)
- 1 ½ cups cooked cannellini or other white bean or 1 can, rinsed
- 3-4 cups chopped kale or other hearty green
- ½ cup chopped cilantro or watercress
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
- Salt & Pepper

## Instructions
1. Warm your oven up to 400 degrees and grab a large, rimmed baking sheet. In a large bowl mix together the squash, red onion, maple syrup, olive oil, five spice powder, and salt until everything looks coated. Take a sniff because this shit should already smell amazing. Dump the veggies onto the baking tray in one layer. Throw this in the oven and roast it for about 30 minutes, stirring it up halfway. You want the squash to look nice and golden brown in some spots and the onion to look almost burnt.
1. While that’s roasting let's make the rest of the soup. In a large pot warm up about a tablespoon of olive oil over a medium heat. Toss in the leek with a pinch of salt and saute it around until it's starting to brown in some spots, about 5-7 minutes. Add the ginger and saute it together for another 2 minutes. Add in the garlic, red pepper flakes, five spice, sage, and bay leaves and stir that all up for another minute or two. Your kitchen should smell fucking amazing. Pour in the veggie broth, turn the heat up to medium high, and let the pot come to a simmer.
1. Once you are at a solid simmer, toss in the pasta and beans and cook that shit until the pasta is tender. That time will vary based on what pasta you chose to PAY ATTENTION motherfucker. Once everything is tender, fish out the sage and bay leaves and toss them. Their job is done. Stir in the kale and then turn off the heat. Scrape in the roasted delicata and onions, reserving a few to add on top of the bowls when you serve them. Not required but it makes that shit look extra fancy. Add the cilantro, nutmeg, and salt and pepper to taste. Your whole place should smell like fall. You’re fucking welcome.
1. Serve warm with a little extra nutmeg and cilantro on top. 

* We know it seems weird to keep the skin on but it gets super tender when you roast it. You won't even know that shit is there. Embrace the laziest winter squash.
