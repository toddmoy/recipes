# Mushroom Shawarma Pita

## Ingredients

* ¾ pound portobello mushroom caps, sliced 1/2-inch thick
* 1 medium red onion, halved and cut into 1/3-inch wedges
* 3 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* ¾ teaspoon ground coriander
* ½ teaspoon ground sweet or smoked paprika (optional)
* Kosher salt and black pepper
* 4 pitas
* 2 packed cups very thinly sliced red cabbage (about 6 ounces)
* ¾ cup low-fat or whole-milk Greek yogurt
* ¾ teaspoon ground turmeric
* Cilantro or mint, for serving

## Instructions

1. Heat the oven to 425 degrees. On a large rimmed sheet pan, drizzle the mushrooms and red onion with 3 tablespoons oil. Sprinkle with cumin, coriander, paprika (if using), 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper; toss to coat. Arrange in an even layer and roast until tender and browned, about 20 minutes. Add the pitas directly to the oven rack to warm during the last 5 minutes of cooking.
2. Meanwhile, toss cabbage with remaining 2 teaspoons oil in a medium bowl; toss to coat. Season generously with salt and pepper. In a small bowl, stir together yogurt and turmeric; season with salt and pepper.
3. To serve, slather yogurt over warm pitas. Top with cabbage, mushroom mixture and herbs, and serve immediately.
