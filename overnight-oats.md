# Overnight Oats

## Ingredients

* 1/3 to 1/2 cup liquid such as dairy milk, almond, cashew or coconut milk
* 1/3 to 1/2 cup old-fashioned rolled oats
* 1/3 to 1/2 cup yogurt, optional
* 1 teaspoon chia seeds, optional but highly recommended
* 1/2 banana, mashed, optional
* Serving suggestions: fruit (fresh or dried), nuts, nut butter, seeds, protein powder, granola, coconut, spices, citrus zest and vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Add the desired amounts of milk, oats, yogurt, chia seeds and banana to a jar or container and give them a good stir. Refrigerate overnight or for at least 5 hours. 
1. In the morning, add additional liquid if you'd like. Once you achieve the desired consistency, top with fruit, nuts, nut butter, seeds, protein powder, granola, coconut, spices, zest or vanilla extract.

## Note

The mixture will keep for up to 2 days. If you don't add the banana, up to 4 days. However, once you are experienced, you'll have no problem whipping up another batch midweek if needed!
