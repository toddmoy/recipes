# Sicilian Salad

## Ingredients

2 ounces ricotta salata cheese, crumbled
1/4 cup drained capers, chopped
8 anchovy fillets, minced to a paste
2 teaspoons dried oregano
2 teaspoons grated orange zest, plus 2 medium navel oranges
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more to serve
1 small red onion, halved, root removed and cut lengthwise into ¼-inch slices
3 small fennel bulbs, trimmed
1/3 cup Castelvetrano olives (see note), pitted and sliced

## Instructions

1.  Set aside 2 tablespoons of the ricotta salata for garnish. In a large bowl, stir together the remaining ricotta, the capers, anchovies, oregano, orange zest and oil. Add the onion and toss to coat; set aside.
1.  Halve each fennel bulb lengthwise, then cut each half crosswise into thin slices. Alternatively, if you have a mandoline, adjust the blade to slice 1/16 thick. Working one at a time, hold the fennel bulb by the base and thinly slice. Add the sliced fennel to the bowl and toss to combine.
1.  Cut ½ inch off the top and bottom of the oranges. Working one at a time, stand the oranges on a cut end and, slicing from top to bottom, cut away the peel and pith following the contour of the fruit. Cut the orange vertically into quarters, then trim away the seedy core from each quarter. Cut each quarter crosswise into ¼-inch-thick slices. Add the oranges to the bowl and toss.
1.  Transfer to a serving platter or bowl and sprinkle with the reserved ricotta salata and the olives. Drizzle with additional oil and serve.
