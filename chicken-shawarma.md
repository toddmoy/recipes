# Chicken Shawarma (Option 1)

## Ingredients

### Chicken:

* 1 pound 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut in half lengthwise
* 1 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* Juice from 1 medium lemon
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 teaspoon cumin
* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
* ¼ teaspoon turmeric
* ¼ teaspoon curry powder
* 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon
* Pinch red pepper flakes
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

### Garlic yogurt sauce:

* 7-ounce container 2% Greek yogurt (I like Fage)
* 2 teaspoons lemon juice
* 2 garlic cloves, finely minced
* 1/8 tsp kosher salt
* Chopped parsley, for garnish

## Instructions

1. Place the chicken breasts, 1 at a time, in a Ziploc bag.  Pound each breast to an even thickness, about ½-inch thick, being careful not to puncture the bag. Place pounded chicken breasts back into bag and set aside.
1. In a medium bowl, combine olive oil and lemon juice.  Whisk until combined.  Add the garlic, cumin, paprika, turmeric, curry powder, cinnamon, red pepper, salt and black pepper and whisk again.
1. Pour the marinade into the bag with the chicken, massaging it to evenly coat.  Refrigerate and marinate for at least 1 hour, up to overnight.
1. In a small bowl (or right in the container), combine the yogurt, garlic, lemon juice and salt.  Stir to combine and refrigerate until ready to use.
1. Over medium-high heat, grill the chicken for 3 minutes or until it no longer sticks to the grill. Turn the chicken and grill an additional 3-4 minutes.  Allow the chicken to rest for 5 minutes then slice it thinly, across the grain.  Top each breast with 2 tablespoons sauce and a sprinkle of parsley.  Serve.

# Chicken Shawarma (Option 2)

## Ingredients

- ¾ tbsp ground cumin
- ¾ tbsp turmeric powder
- ¾ tbsp ground coriander
- ¾ tbsp garlic powder
- ¾ tbsp paprika
- ½ tsp ground cloves
- ½ tsp cayenne pepper, more if you prefer
- Salt
- 8 boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 1 large onion, thinly sliced
- 1 large lemon, juice of
- ⅓ cup Private Reserve extra virgin olive oil

## Instructions

1. In a small bowl, mix the cumin, turmeric, coriander, garlic powder, sweet paprika and cloves. Set aside the shawarma spice mix for now.
1. Pat the chicken thighs dry and season with salt on both sides, then thinly slice into small bite-sized pieces.
1. Place the chicken in a large bowl. Add the shwarma spices and toss to coat. Add the onions, lemon juice and olive oil. Toss everything together again. Cover and refrigerate for 3 hours or overnight (if you don't have time, you can cut or skip marinating time)
1. When ready, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Take the chicken out of the fridge and let it sit in room temperature for a few minutes.
1. Spread the marinated chicken with the onions in one layer on a large lightly-oiled baking sheet pan. Roast for 30 minutes in the 425 degrees F heated-oven. For a more browned, crispier chicken, move the pan to the top rack and broil very briefly (watch carefully). Remove from the oven.
1. While the chicken is roasting, prepare the pita pockets. Make tahini sauce according to this recipe or Tztaziki sauce according to this recipe. Make 3-ingredient Mediterranean salad according to this recipe. Set aside.
1. To serve, open pita pockets up. Spread a little tahini sauce or Tzatziki sauce, add chicken shawarma, arugula, Mediterranean salad and pickles or olives, if you like. Serve immediately!
