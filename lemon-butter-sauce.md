# Lemon Butter Sauce

## Ingredients

- 1 small shallot
- 2 cloves garlic
- 2 to 3 medium lemons
- 1 small bunch fresh parsley
- 6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, divided
- 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Dice 1 small shallot (about 1/4 cup). Mince 2 garlic cloves. Juice 2 to 3 lemons until you have 3 tablespoons juice. Pick and finely chop the leaves from 1 small bunch parsley until you have 3 tablespoons. Cut 6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter into 6 pieces.
1. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook, stirring frequently, until shallot is beginning to soften, 1 minute. Add the garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until both garlic and shallot are light golden-brown, 1 to 2 minutes more.
1. Add the lemon juice then 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Boil until sauce reduces by half, about 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to low. While whisking, add the remaining butter and continue to whisk constantly until all the butter is melted and incorporated.
1. Add 1 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper and stir to combine. Add the parsley and stir to combine. Taste and season with more kosher salt as needed.
