# Kielbalsa & Cabbage

## Ingredients

- 1 medium Savoy cabbage (2 to 2 1/2 pounds), cut through the root into 1-inch-thick wedges
- ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for tossing the cabbage
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 8 ounces to 1 pound smoked kielbasa, diagonally sliced 1/4-inch-thick
- ¼ cup red wine vinegar
- ¼ cup finely chopped fresh dill
- 1 shallot, finely chopped
- 4 teaspoons Dijon mustard
- 1 (14-ounce) can white beans, such as great Northern or cannellini, drained and rinsed

## Instructions


1. Heat the oven to 450 degrees. Add the cabbage to a rimmed baking sheet and toss with olive oil, salt and pepper to coat. Arrange in an even layer, then scatter the kielbasa on top. Roast without flipping until cabbage is tender and charred in spots and the kielbasa is dark golden, 25 to 30 minutes.
1. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, stir together 1/4 cup olive oil with the vinegar, dill, shallot, mustard, 2 teaspoons salt and a few grinds of pepper. Add the beans and stir to combine.
1. Divide the cabbage and sausage among plates and spoon the beans and vinaigrette on top.
