# Biscuits

(Adapted for high elevation) 

## Ingredients

* 4 cups all-purpose flour
* 4 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 cup unsalted butter, cut into cubes
* 1 1/2 cups buttermilk
* 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
1. In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda. Add cold butter, using your fingers to work the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles coarse crumbs. Add buttermilk and stir using a rubber spatula until a soft dough forms.
1. Working on a lightly floured surface, knead the dough 3-4 times until it comes together. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 1 1/4-inch thick rectangle. Cut out 10-12 rounds using a 2 1/2-inch biscuit or cookie cutter. Place biscuits onto the prepared baking sheet; place in the freezer for 15 minutes.
1. Remove biscuits from freezer and brush tops with butter. Place into oven and bake for 15-18 minutes, or until golden brown.
1. Serve warm.
