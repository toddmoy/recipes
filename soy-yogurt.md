# Soy Yogurt

## Ingredients

* 1 32 oz. container of unsweetened PLAIN soy milk water and soybeans as the only ingredients
* 5 probiotic capsules with 2.4 billion CFUs or any number of capsules totaling 12 billion CFU (first batch only). For all subsequent batches, use ½ cup of plain yogurt from your last batch as a starter.

## Instructions

1. Add the contents of a new factory sealed container of soy milk directly into a clean instant pot.
1. Add the probiotic or starter.
1. Stir well with a whisk until completely blended.
1. Push the yogurt button on the instant pot and use the + sign to change the time to 15 hours.
1. Place the lid on top and make sure the valve is turned to vent to allow humidity to escape.
1. Wait 15 hours and come back when the yogurt timer beeps.
1. Use a spoon to drain off any water that formed at the top of the yogurt.
1. Let it cool to room temperature and transfer to sealed containers.
1. Save ½ cup of yogurt with nothing added for your next batch.

## Notes

* The yogurt will taste more like store-bought soy yogurt once the culture matures and you make the yogurt from the starter.
* Reduce cook time by an hour or two for less tangy yogurt.
* Increase cook time by an hour or two for more tangy yogurt.
