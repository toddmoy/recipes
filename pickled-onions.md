# Pickled Onions

## Ingredients

* 1 large red onion, peeled and very thinly sliced
* 3/4 cup apple cider vinegar
* 1 teaspoon fine sea salt
* 1â€“2 tablespoons sweetener (such as maple syrup, honey, sugar, etc.)

## Instructions

1. In a small saucepan, stir together the vinegar, salt and your desired amount of sweetener. Cook over medium-high heat until the mixture reaches a simmer.
1. Place the thinly-sliced onions in a small bowl or pint-sized mason jar. Pour the hot vinegar mixture over the onions. Stir until combined. (Or if using a mason jar, place the lid on top and give the jar a quick shake.) Let the onions marinate for 30 minutes.
