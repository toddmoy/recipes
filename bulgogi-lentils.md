# Bulgogi Lentils

## Ingredients

* 1 ½ cup Green Lentils, cooked
* ½ cup Walnuts, chopped
* 1 ½ cup Cremini Mushrooms, chopped
* 1 Yellow Onion, diced
* 3-4 cloves Garlic, minced
* Olive Oil or Vegetable Stock, for sautéing
* Salt, to taste
* Black Pepper, to taste

**Bulgogi Sauce:**

* 4-5 cloves Garlic, minced
* 1-inch piece Ginger, minced
* 2 tbsp. Maple Syrup
* 2 tbsp. Tamari
* 1 tbsp. Rice Wine Vinegar
* 3-4 Scallions, sliced thinly
* 1 tsp. Chili Flakes (optional)
* 1 tbsp. Sesame Oil (optional)
* 1 tbsp. Sesame Seeds (optional)
* Black Pepper, to taste
* Salt, to taste

## Directions

1. Rinse and chop the produce accordingly.  Whisk together the sauce ingredients and set aside.
1. Set a large pan or skillet to medium heat.  Once hot, add 1 tsp. olive oil or vegetable stock.  Then, add onion and garlic.  Cook until onion is translucent, stirring occasionally to avoid burning, 4-5 minutes.
1. Add the mushrooms.  Cook until the mushrooms have released their liquid, about 4-5 minutes.
1. Add the lentils, walnuts, and sauce.  Stir to combine and evenly warmed through.  Cook until sauce has thickened, about 3-4 minutes.  Avoid mixing too vigorously to avoid mashing the lentils.
1. Serve with brown rice, pickled vegetables, lime wedge, and other cooked vegetables.  Garnish with fresh cilantro, sesame seeds, and sriracha.  Enjoy!
